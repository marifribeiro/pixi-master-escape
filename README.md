# Escape in Pixi.js

## Introduction

This is a small project of a escape game entirely constructed by me in Pixi.js.
You need to help a five year old boy that is locked up in his to get out.
Help him out by using your mouse to click wherever you want the little kid to go. He will tell you what's on his mind.
